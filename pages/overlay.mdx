# Introduction

In this example, we want to help you launch an overlay campaign in Resonance.

The campaign takes the form of a modal, it's triggered by a button click in your product (you can choose which button), and its goal is to optimize some sort of conversion event (you can also choose the name for this - we go with <strong>test_event</strong>).

A example of such a banner is below. It is simple, as it has a configurable title, description, and two buttons with configurable text, as well as a click through event.
