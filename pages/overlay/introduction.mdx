# Introduction

In this example, we want to help you launch an overlay campaign in Resonance.

The campaign takes the form of a modal, it's triggered by a button click in your product (you can choose which button), and its goal is to optimize some sort of conversion event (you can also choose the name for this - we go with <strong>test_event</strong>).

A example of such a banner is below. It is simple, as it has a configurable title, description, and two buttons with configurable text, as well as a click through event.

import "@radix-ui/themes/styles.css";
import {Theme, Button, Dialog, Flex} from "@radix-ui/themes";

<br/>
<br/>
{<Theme>
    <Dialog.Root>
        <Dialog.Trigger>
            <Button variant={'soft'}>See Modal</Button>
        </Dialog.Trigger>

        <Dialog.Content maxWidth={'450px'}>
            <Dialog.Title>Modal Title</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description size={'2'} mb={'4'}>
                Modal Description
            </Dialog.Description>

            <Flex gap={'3'} mt={'4'} justify={'end'}>
                <Dialog.Close>
                    <Button variant={'soft'} color={'gray'}>
                        First CTA Button
                    </Button>
                </Dialog.Close>
                <Dialog.Close>
                    <Button>Second CTA Button</Button>
                </Dialog.Close>
            </Flex>
        </Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Root>
</Theme>}
