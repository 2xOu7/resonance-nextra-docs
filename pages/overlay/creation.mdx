        Upon creating the campaign, you will be redirected to the
        Campaign Builder UI. In the <strong>Builder</strong> tab,
        you should see two variants by default (v1 and v2), and a
        list of input elements, which come from your application
        settings JSON.

        Input text for each input field (ideally different values
        for v1 and v2). You can ignore the{' '}
        <strong>First CTA Action</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>Second CTA Action</strong>. Save the campaign by
        clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the top right
        and selecting <strong>Save</strong> from the following
        menu.
