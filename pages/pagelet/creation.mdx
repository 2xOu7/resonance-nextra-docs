    <p>
        If everything went well, then you should be able to create
        a campaign in the Resonance web console (i.e.{' '}
        <strong>app.{`{your_domain}`}.useresonance.com.)</strong>
    </p>

        Go to the menu at the top left, go to{' '}
        <strong>Create</strong>, and select{' '}
        <strong>Overlay</strong>.
    </Blockquote>
    <br />
    <Blockquote>
        Enter a name for your new campaign. Select{' '}
        <strong>Modal</strong> as an option in the dropdown - the
        dropdown menu is populated based on the application
        settings JSON <strong>overlayFormats</strong> field.

        Upon creating the campaign, you will be redirected to the
        Campaign Builder UI. In the <strong>Builder</strong> tab,
        you should see two variants by default (v1 and v2), and a
        list of input elements, which come from your application
        settings JSON.

    <br />
    <Blockquote>
        Input text for each input field (ideally different values
        for v1 and v2). You can ignore the{' '}
        <strong>First CTA Action</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>Second CTA Action</strong>. Save the campaign by
        clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the top right
        and selecting <strong>Save</strong> from the following
        menu.

        Go to <strong>Conditions</strong> and select the{' '}
        <strong>Button Clicked</strong> event from the{' '}
        <strong>Trigger Event</strong> dropdown. This dropdown is
        also populated by the <strong>events</strong> field of the
        application settings JSON.
    </Blockquote>

        Lastly, go to <strong>Experimentation</strong>. From here,
        configure the <strong>Rollout Percentage</strong> to 100,
        choose <strong>test_event</strong> (or whatever you passed
        in to <strong>logConversion</strong>) from the{' '}
        <strong>Success Event</strong> dropdown, and select all
        from the <strong>Primary + Secondary Metrics</strong>{' '}
        dropdowns.
    </Blockquote>
    <br />
    <Blockquote>
        Click on <strong>Edit</strong> in the top right and click{' '}
        <strong>Save</strong>. Then, do the same thing, but then
        click <strong>Activate</strong>.The page should refresh
        and there should be a green badge next to{' '}
        <strong>Edit</strong>.
