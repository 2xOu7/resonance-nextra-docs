# Introduction

In this example, we want to help you launch a pagelet campaign in Resonance. Pagelets are inline components that are embedded into your application, akin to native ad units.

For this example, the campaign that we are launching takes the form of an embedded banner, it's strategically placed below the navigation bar of our website (you can choose where you want to place the banner), and its goal is to optimize some sort of conversion event (you can also choose the name for this - we go with test_event).

A example of such a modal is below. It is simple, as it has a body, one button with configurable call-to-action, as well as a click through event.

import {
    Theme, Callout, Flex, Button
} from "@radix-ui/themes";
import { InfoCircledIcon } from '@radix-ui/react-icons';


<br/>
<br/>
<Theme>
    <Callout.Root>
        <Callout.Icon>
            <InfoCircledIcon />
        </Callout.Icon>
        <Callout.Text>Body Text</Callout.Text>
        <Flex gap={'3'}>
            <Button variant={'surface'}>CTA</Button>
        </Flex>
    </Callout.Root>
</Theme>
